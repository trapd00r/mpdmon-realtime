mpdmon-realtime
===============
This version of mpdmon shows a one-line string with playingtime/totaltime
and the artist/album/title. Good for including in screens hardstatusline,
conky, dzen2, your small shell up in the right corner or whatever.
If you want to be able to see history, you'll want [mpdmon-full][1]
